## 1. Comparison of Function and Variable Syntax in C and Python

### Function Syntax:

### C:
In C, functions must be declared with a specific return type and parameter types. The function body is enclosed in curly braces.

```c
int add(int x, int y) {
    return x + y;
}
```

### Python:
In Python, functions are defined using the def keyword, followed by the function name and parameters. There is no need to specify the return type, and indentation defines the function body.

```python
def add(x, y):
    return x + y

```

### Variable Syntax:

### C:

Variables in C must be explicitly declared with a type before they can be used.

```c
int x = 10;
float y = 5.5;
```

### Python:

Python uses dynamic typing, so variables are declared by assigning a value without specifying a type.

```python
x = 10
y = 5.5
```

## 2. Comparison of Types in C and Python

### C Types:

### Primitive Types:

int: Integer values.
float: Single-precision floating-point numbers.
double: Double-precision floating-point numbers.
char: Single characters.
long: Long integers.

### Derived Types:

array: Collection of elements of the same type.
pointer: A variable that holds the memory address of another variable.
struct: A user-defined data structure that can hold variables of different types.

```c
int x = 10;
float y = 5.5;
double z = 9.9;
char c = 'A';
```

### Python Types:

### Primitive Types:

int: Integers (no size limitation as in C).
float: Floating-point numbers.
str: Strings.
bool: Boolean values (True or False).

### Advanced Types:

list: Ordered, mutable collections.
tuple: Ordered, immutable collections.
dict: Unordered collections of key-value pairs.
set: Unordered collections of unique elements.

```python
x = 10
y = 5.5
z = 9.9
c = 'A'
```

## 3. Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in Python

### Definition/Summary:

OOP in Python is a programming paradigm where data and functions are bundled into objects. This allows for better organization and reuse of code.

### Explanation:

In Python, classes define the blueprint for objects. They contain methods (functions) and attributes (variables). Python's OOP is more flexible than C, which does not support OOP natively.

### Example:

```python
class Dog:
    def __init__(self, name):
        self.name = name
    
    def bark(self):
        return f"{self.name} says woof!"

my_dog = Dog("Fido")
print(my_dog.bark())  # Output: Fido says woof!
```

### 4. Loops in Python and C

### While Loop:

### C:

```c
int i = 0;
while (i < 5) {
    printf("i = %d\n", i);
    i++;
}
```

### Python:

```python
i = 0
while i < 5:
    print(f"i = {i}")
    i += 1
```

### For Loop:

### C:

```javascript
for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
    printf("i = %d\n", i);
}
```

### Python

```python
for i in range(5):
    print(f"i = {i}")
```

### For-Each Loop:

### C:

C does not natively support a for-each loop; you would use a standard for loop to iterate over arrays.

### Python:

```python
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
for fruit in fruits:
    print(fruit)
```

### Loop with Break and Continue:

### C:

```c
for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
    if (i == 3) {
        continue;
    }
    if (i == 4) {
        break;
    }
    printf("i = %d\n", i);
}
```

### Python

```python
for i in range(5):
    if i == 3:
        continue
    if i == 4:
        break
    print(f"i = {i}")
```

## 5. Functions in Python and C

### Simple Function:

### C:

```c
int square(int x) {
    return x * x;
}
```

### Python

```python
def square(x):
    return x * x
```

### Recursive Function:

### C:

```c
int factorial(int n) {
    if (n <= 1) return 1;
    return n * factorial(n - 1);
}
```

### Python

```python
def factorial(n):
    if n <= 1:
        return 1
    return n * factorial(n - 1)
```

### Lambda Function:

### C:
C does not support anonymous functions natively.

### Python:

```python
square = lambda x: x * x
print(square(5))  # Output: 25
```

## 6. Truncation in Python

### Definition/Summary:

Truncation in Python refers to the process of shortening a floating-point number by removing its decimal part, effectively converting it to an integer.

### Explanation:

In Python, truncation can be achieved using the int() function, which removes the decimal portion without rounding.

### Example:

```python
x = 5.99
y = int(x)
print(y)  # Output: 5
```

### C Equivalent:

In C, truncation happens implicitly when a float is assigned to an int variable.

```c
float x = 5.99;
int y = (int)x;
printf("%d\n", y);  // Output: 5
```

## 7. Exception Handling in Python

### Definition/Summary:

Exception handling in Python involves using try, except, and finally blocks to manage errors that occur during program execution.

### Explanation:

Python’s exception handling allows you to catch and handle errors gracefully, preventing the program from crashing.

### Example:

```python
try:
    x = int(input("Enter a number: "))
    print(f"The number is {x}")
except ValueError:
    print("That's not a number!")
finally:
    print("Execution complete.")
```

### Mentioned Exception in Class:

The lecture mentions a ValueError that occurs when attempting to convert a non-integer string to an integer using the int() function.

## 8. Mario Example in C and Python

### C Implementation:

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main(void) {
    int height = 4;
    for (int i = 0; i < height; i++) {
        for (int j = 0; j < height - i - 1; j++) {
            printf(" ");
        }
        for (int k = 0; k <= i; k++) {
            printf("#");
        }
        printf("\n");
    }
    return 0;
}
```

### Python Implementation:

```python
height = 4
for i in range(height):
    print(" " * (height - i - 1) + "#" * (i + 1))
```

## 9. List in Python

### Definition/Summary:

A list in Python is an ordered, mutable collection of items that can be of mixed types.

### Explanation:

Lists in Python are versatile and can hold different data types. Lists are indexed and support various operations like slicing, appending, and iterating.

### Examples:

### Basic List:

```python
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
```

### Appending to List:

```python
fruits.append("orange")
```

### Slicing a List:

```python
print(fruits[1:3])  # Output: ['banana', 'cherry']
```

### Iterating Over a List:

```python
for fruit in fruits:
    print(fruit)
```

## 10. Dictionary in Python

### Definition/Summary:

A dictionary in Python is an unordered collection of key-value pairs. It is similar to hash tables in other languages.

### Explanation:

Dictionaries allow for fast lookups, insertion, and deletion. They are indexed by keys, which can be of any immutable type.

### Examples:

### Basic Dictionary:

```python
ages = {"Alice": 25, "Bob": 30, "Charlie": 35}
```

### Accessing a Value:

```python
print(ages["Alice"])  # Output: 25
```

### Adding a Key-Value Pair:

```python
ages["David"] = 40
```

### Iterating Over a Dictionary:

```python
for name, age in ages.items():
    print(f"{name} is {age} years old")
```

## 11. Sys Library in Python

### Definition/Summary:

The sys library in Python provides access to some variables used or maintained by the interpreter and functions that interact with the interpreter.

### Explanation:

sys is often used to manipulate the runtime environment, handle command-line arguments, and manage the standard input/output streams.

### Examples:

### Command-Line Arguments:

```python
import sys

if len(sys.argv) != 2:
    print("Usage: python script.py <name>")
    sys.exit(1)

name = sys.argv[1]
print(f"Hello, {name}!")
```

### Exiting a Program:

```javascript
sys.exit("Exiting the program due to an error.")
```

### Standard Output Redirection:

```javascript
import sys

sys.stdout.write("This is a message.\n")
```
